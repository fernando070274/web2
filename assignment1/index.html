                        I want you by my side
                        So that I never feel alone again
                        They’ve always been so kind
                        But now they’ve brought you away from here
                        I hope they didn’t get your mind
                        Your heart is too strong anyway
                        We need to fetch back the time
                        They have stolen from us

                        And I want you
                        We can bring it on the floor
                        You’ve never danced like this before
                        We don’t talk about it
                        Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
                        Stoned in paradise, shouldn’t talk about it

                        Shouldn't talk about it

                        Coldest winter for me
                        No sun is shining anymore
                        The only thing I feel is pain
                        Caused by absence of you
                        Suspense is controlling my mind
                        I cannot find the way out of here
                        I want you by my side
                        So that I never feel alone again
